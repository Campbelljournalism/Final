      <h3>Crime</h3>
      <h1>Are Driver's Tests Really Keeping Roads Safe?</h1>

      <p>Within the first nine months of 2023, there were 30,435 vehicle collisions according to The United States Department of Transportation and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). On average, there are around 111 car collisions per day based on the nine month outlook.  While shocking, this proved to be a 4.5% decrease from 2022, after a previous trend of yearly increases, the new analysis of NHTSA data found.  For a period of time, car collisions were one of the leading causes of death.  Vehicle collisions happen on a daily basis as we’ve discovered, but one factor is a leading predictor of your chance at being involved in the next one.</p>

      <p>Through an analysis it has been found that gender is an indicator of your likelihood to get in an accident.  Male drivers got into accidents or double the amount that female drivers had experienced, the data reveals from NHTSA. </p>
      <p>When looking at New York specifically, the New York Government compiled a list of collisions from 2013 to March of 2024. While the data broke down the state, license plate, area of collision, number of people involved, but more importantly - gender of driver(s).  Throughout the years, it became clear that male drivers get into more accidents than female drivers.</p>

      <p>“Men tend to speed, tailgate, merge dangerously, and make rude gestures or honk at other drivers more than women,” said Valerie Puma, a spokesperson for the western and central New York chapter of AAA.  Puma referenced a 2019 study by AAA that confirmed that the statistics had a bigger story behind them. This has not been a recent phenomenon, though, as seen in a 1990 study collisions involving men were three times more likely than those involving women (National Library of Medicine). </p>
      <p>While aggressive tendencies play into the collision rates, alcohol is also a leading cause of collisions to not dismiss. The trends of male dominating the collision rates fall into this aspect as well: The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that in 2021, 33% of men in collisions had a higher than legal Blood Alcohol Content level compared to 23% for women (IIHS).  Substances such as alcohol impair the mind and clearly inhibit the ability for drivers to make conscious decisions, but again the impact is more male than female.  </p>

      <p>Overall, when looking at the categories of causation, such as reckless driving or driving under the influence, male drivers lead in each category. This continues throughout each stage of life from teenage, new drivers to elders who are nearing the end of their driving tenure.</p>
      <p>The difference amongst male and female drivers boils down to biological differences in gender.  In a 2018 study in the National Library of Medicine, an aggression and behavioral test was done by gender; ultimately the researchers concluded males are naturally more aggressive and violent than females (National Library of Medicine).</p>
      <p>The aggressive behaviors on the road are inherent, and biology cannot be altered.  Since this is the case, it is important to highlight the differences in behaviors between males and females to educate.  By educating new drivers on this difference, they can be more aware of possible implications when hitting the road.  Reinforcement in driving basics and being in the right headspace while taking the wheel can improve these gender divides.</p>
      <p>Moving forward, the differences in behavior do not allow for 2024 to be a year in which the decrease in collisions stops.  AAA encourages all drivers to follow the speed limits, avoid road rage, and pull over if truly needed to look at that text message.  By following these precautions, everyone can drive safely and peacefully. </p>
